## Divide and Conquer Algorithms: Integer Multiplication & Closest Pair

### Overview
This project implements two classic **divide and conquer algorithms** with a **graphical user interface**:

1. **Integer Multiplication** — Step-by-step multiplication, including partial products and final result.  
2. **Closest Pair of Points** — Efficiently finds the closest pair among a set of points.

Users can select input files via GUI or run the algorithms via command-line interface (CLI).

### Features
- Interactive GUI for file selection and visualization.  
- Step-by-step display of multiplication results.  
- Dynamic plots for results using **Matplotlib**.  
- Handles large datasets (input size > 100).
