# Divide and Conquer Algorithms: Integer Multiplication & Closest Pair

## Overview
This project implements two classic **divide and conquer algorithms** with a **graphical user interface**:

1. **Integer Multiplication** — Step-by-step multiplication, including partial products and final result.
2. **Closest Pair of Points** — Efficiently finds the closest pair among a set of points.

Users can select input files via GUI or run the algorithms via command-line interface (CLI).

## Features
- Interactive GUI for file selection and visualization.
- Step-by-step display of multiplication results.
- Dynamic plots for results using **Matplotlib**.
- Handles large datasets (input size = 100).
